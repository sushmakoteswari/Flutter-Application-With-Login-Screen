# Flutter-Application-With-Login-Screen
This is Flutter application which is under development.
In this application I had created a login and signup page.
Login page consists of Sign in with Google button.
Firebase:
       By using firebase firestore we can save the data of the users who are signed in the application.Firebase gives us the users authentication to login the users to the application.
RichText - It can be used to differenciate the texts without creating extra coloums or rows to the text.
This app is still under development.
The process needs to be developed - newsapi.org(News api for the news in the card view with search funtion availabity).
